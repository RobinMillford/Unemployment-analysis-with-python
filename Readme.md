**Project Summary:**

In this project, I performed an individual time series analysis and data visualization of unemployment trends in India using Python, pandas, Plotly, and Plotly Express. The primary objective was to explore the dataset, assess unemployment trends, and create informative visualizations. Here's a summary of the key tasks and findings:

**Data Description:**
- The dataset contained information about unemployment rates, employment numbers, labor participation rates, and geographical regions over time.
- Columns included "Region," "Date," "Frequency," "Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)," "Estimated Employed," "Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%)," "Region.1," "longitude," and "latitude."

**Data Preprocessing:**
- Data preprocessing involved converting date columns to the correct datetime format and calculating average values for numerical columns grouped by date.

**Time Series Analysis:**
- Time series analysis focused on the "Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)." An Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test was used to assess stationarity.
- Attempts were made at time series decomposition, but challenges arose due to the data's nature.

**Data Visualization:**
- Plotly Express was utilized to create various visualizations:
  - Line plots were employed to visualize unemployment rate trends over time.
  - Bar charts were used to compare unemployment rates across different regions and dates.

**Key Findings:**
- The dataset provided insights into individual unemployment trends over time, enabling the observation of fluctuations and potential patterns.
- The ADF test indicated that the data was not stationary, suggesting the need for further preprocessing.
- Data visualizations facilitated comparisons of unemployment rates across regions and revealed changes over time.

**Next Steps:**
- Further data preprocessing, such as differencing or transformation, may be required to achieve stationarity.
- Advanced time series models (e.g., ARIMA or SARIMA) can be applied for future predictions or forecasts based on historical data.
- Geospatial analysis and additional exploratory data analysis (EDA) may provide deeper insights into regional variations in unemployment rates.

This individual project forms the foundation for advanced time series analysis and visualization, aiming to better understand and predict unemployment trends over time in India.
